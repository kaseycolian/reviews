# Reviews

Created review links for different musical artists.  Artists reviewed:
* Aphex Twin
* Boards of Canada
* Godspeed You! Black Emperor

Created templates to access Review repository in Eclipse, then injected reviews to front with Thymeleaf and Spring MVC.  Added images from static directory, linked abolute URL links, and embedded YouTube videos to review artists. Originally created HTML style internally before switching to CSS stylesheet.
