# Reviews

Individual Project for We Can Code IT.  Created review sites for different musical artists using the following techniques:

* Used Java with TDD to create repository of reviews and accessor methods.
* Created templates to access repository of reviews in Eclipse.
* Used Spring MVC & Thymeleaf to create front.
* Added images from static directory, linked abolute URL links, and embedded YouTube videos on each artist. 
* Originally created HTML style internally before switching to CSS stylesheet.
